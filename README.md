## Chapter I: Introduction

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet, that provides real-time messaging for public and private conversations. IRC clients connect to servers, forming a network.

## Chapter II: General Rules

- The program should not crash under any circumstances.
- Provide a functional Makefile.
- Compile the code with `c++` using flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Code must comply with the C++98 standard.
- Avoid crashing or unexpectedly quitting for a fully functional project.

## Chapter III: Mandatory Part

### III.1 Requirements

- Develop an IRC server in C++98 named `ircserv`.
- Handle multiple clients simultaneously without hanging.
- No forking allowed; all I/O operations must be non-blocking.
- Use only 1 `poll()` (or equivalent) for handling all operations.
- Implement authentication, nickname setting, channel joining, and private messaging.
- Forward messages to all clients in a channel.
- Support operators and regular users.
- Implement commands specific to operators.

### III.2 For MacOS only

- Use `fcntl()` with `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` for non-blocking mode.

### III.3 Test Example

Verify all possible errors and issues. Use `nc` for a simple test to ensure the correct processing of commands.

## Chapter IV: Bonus Part

- Bonus features: Handle file transfer and implement a bot.
- Bonus part assessed only if the mandatory part is perfect.
